Educational AI Assistant (OpenVINO-Optimized)

This project is a multimodal AI assistant for classroom environments. It helps students and teachers by answering questions using **text**, **voice**, or **images**. The backend is built with **Flask** and optimized using **OpenVINO** for fast performance. The frontend is powered by **React**.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm
- Tesseract OCR installed:
  - Windows: [UB Mannheim Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - Linux: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

---

Installation

Backend Setup (Flask + AI Models)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate   # or source env/bin/activate (Linux/Mac)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

> Make sure to set Tesseract path in `app.py` (for Windows):

```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
```

Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

*  Ask questions like: ‚ÄúWhat is Newton‚Äôs Second Law?‚Äù
*  Upload a textbook diagram and extract key points
*  Speak a question into the mic and get a response

---

Performance

| Feature   | Speed & Accuracy          |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Text Q\&A | < 2s (OpenVINO optimized) |
| OCR       | \~90% accuracy            |
| Speech    | \~85% (depends on mic)    |

Security Notes

* File uploads are sanitized and stored temporarily
* No user data is permanently saved
* CORS enabled for safe frontend-backend communication

---

Future Enhancements

* Chat history for users
* Support Indian regional languages
* Add emotion detection using webcam
